1. Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B
EX:
input 29, 15
output 2
(A = 11101, B = 01111 )

2. Implement a method to perorm basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
If the compressed string would be longer, return the original String.
EX:
aabcccccaaa --> a2b1c5a3
abcd -/> a1b1c1d1
hint/extra: find the final string size BEFORE compession


3. Design a hashmap to store user names.  Write a hash function that has a parameter "username", and generate a key, without collisions, accepting [A-Z[a-z][0-9]
